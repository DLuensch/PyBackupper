[PyBackupperConfigs] #Do not change this line!
#
# This file must be refereced at PyBackupper startup!
#
# Add your configs here! All configs will be successively executed!
# Configs can be referenced absolutely or relatively. 
#
# The idea is to create some of these configs for different backups. 
# E.g.: Daily backup, weekly backup and so on.
#
#
# sample_backup_1 = Name of the backup, will be the root folder.
# ./config/sample_cfg.cfg = Path to the actual config of the backup.
sample_backup_1 = ./config/sample_cfg.cfg
#
# Next config
#name_of_the_backup = full_or_relative_path_to_the_cfg/config_name.cfg
#
# .. and so on ...
